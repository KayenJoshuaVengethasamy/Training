BufferedReader class
	Synchronous
	Should be used in multiple threaded application
	Large buffer(8KB byte buffer)
	Slightly faster as it simply reads sequence of characters
Scanner
	Not synchronous
	Should be avoided in multiple threaded application
	Small buffer (1KB char buffer)
	Slower as it does parsing of input data
	Preferred when we take user input for small operations
