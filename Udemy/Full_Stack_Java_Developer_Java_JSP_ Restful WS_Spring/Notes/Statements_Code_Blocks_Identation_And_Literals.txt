Statements, Code blocks

Statements is a complete instruction
in Java, statemnet ends with semi-colon;
Code block is a set of statemnets
in Java, code blocks is enclosed within braces{}

Literals

A sequence of characters that represent constant values to be stored in variables

Integer literals

Literals for different number systems
Prefix 0 is used to indicate octal and prefix 0x indicates hexadecimal, 0 and 0x are literals
Prefix 0B/0b is used for binary number systems
eg	:	int decimal = 785;
		int octal = 0176;
		int hexa = 0x94;
		int bi = 0b110;

Floating-point literals

Java has two kinds of floating-point numbers, float and double
Default is double
Literal can be used to override default

eg	:	float doubleVal = 12.25D; //optional
		float floatValue = 52.444F;
		double floatValue = 54.963f;
		double doubleValue = 5241.66632d; //optional

Character Literals

Specify a character literal for assignment of char variable
eg	:	car x = 'v'
		char m = 062;//ANSI equivalent of the character. Look at the ANSI chart online

Escape sequence

Escape or unescapes is a string removing traces of offending characters that could prevent compiling
Research all java escape sequences but below are some examples
eg	:	Backspace is replaced with \b
		Newline is replaced with \n
		Tab is replaced with \t
		Carriage is replaced with \r
		Form feed is replaced with \f
		Double quote is replaced with \"
		Backslash is replaced with \\

Null Literals

Null is not a keyword, null is a literal used to specify null value (nothing) for an element

Boolean literals

The values true and false are treated as literals in Java
True means correct, whereas false specify incorrect
eg	:	boolean test = true;
